\section{Introduction}
This module `Grinding Lenses follows the module `Lenses' or `Parabolic Mirrors' and can lead to `Telescopes'. When you completed all these modules you should be able to make your own telescope with the help of the module `Making your own telescope' and explain how it works. This module, like `Parabolic Mirrors' is more technical then the previous ones because it focusses more on constructing a lens then on the mathematics behind the workings of a lens.

It is assumed that you know and understand the Pythagorean theorem.

\section{Constructing spheres}
A sphere is a three-dimensional surface, all points of which are equidistant from a fixed point; the centre. This distance is called the radius $r$. Using the Pythagorean theorem we can describe the surface of a sphere (in Cartesian coordinates) in a single mathematical formula:
\begin{equation}
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2 \label{eq:sphere}
\end{equation}

Lets see what happens when we cut away a slice of the sphere. We take a sphere with a radius of 5.0~cm and take away a 1.0~cm thick slice. We made the cut at $z=4.0$~cm.
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + y^2 + 4.0^2 = 5.0^2 ~~\Rightarrow~~ x^2 + y^2 = 3.0^2
\end{equation*}
This equation tells us that the cut made is circular in shape and has a radius of 3.0~cm. Making a plano convex lens is therefore easy, just slice of a piece of a glass sphere. First however we need to obtain a (part of a) glass sphere.

Grinding lenses can be done by rotating a glass pane and `cutting' away glass from the top with a rotating cylinder which is placed at an angle to the rotating plane. Machining in this fashion will result in a partial sphere. A suitable cylinder to use if you want to try this process for yourself is a hole saw. See figure \ref{fig:grinding_setup} for a possible setup to grind lenses.

It is important to align the axis of rotation in such a way that axis of the hole saw cuts crosses the axis of the rotating pane. Trying this process with glass can be quite dangerous, a safer alternative is Plexiglas (Poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA). If everything is rotating properly we end up with a nice sphere (without a strange tip at the top). The hole saw however cuts away material quite crude, we therefore do not obtain a nice smooth surface.

After cutting we can sand down the surface to make it smoother. To do this take a piece of tubing with the same diameter as the hole saw  and cover the end with sandpaper. Use this `sander' in the same way as the hole saw. A different method uses grinding paste made from water and fine sand to polish the surface. Multiple polishing steps are needed, each with a finer polishing paste. Scouring cleaning agents can be used as an intermediate coarseness and copper polish as the finest polish. When we are done with polishing we end up with a plano convex lens. The lens makers equation can be used to calculate its strength.
